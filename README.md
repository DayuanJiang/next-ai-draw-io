</div>

A Next.js web application that integrates AI capabilities with draw.io diagrams. Create, modify, and enhance diagrams through natural language commands and AI-assisted visualization.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2eef5f3-b335-4e71-a755-dc2e80931979

## Features

-   **LLM-Powered Diagram Creation**: Leverage Large Language Models to create and manipulate draw.io diagrams directly through natural language commands
-   **Image-Based Diagram Replication**: Upload existing diagrams or images and have the AI replicate and enhance them automatically
-   **Diagram History**: Comprehensive version control that tracks all changes, allowing you to view and restore previous versions of your diagrams before the AI editing.
-   **Interactive Chat Interface**: Communicate with AI to refine your diagrams in real-time
-   **AWS Architecture Diagram Support**: Specialized support for generating AWS architecture diagrams
-   **Animated Connectors**: Create dynamic and animated connectors between diagram elements for better visualization

## **Examples**

Here are some example prompts and their generated diagrams:

<div align="center">
<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" valign="top" align="center">
      <strong>Animated transformer connectors</strong><br />
      <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Give me a **animated connector** diagram of transformer's architecture.</p>
      <img src="./public/animated_connectors.svg" alt="Transformer Architecture with Animated Connectors" width="480" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>GCP architecture diagram</strong><br />
      <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Generate a GCP architecture diagram with **GCP icons**. In this diagram, users connect to a frontend hosted on an instance.</p>
      <img src="./public/gcp_demo.svg" alt="GCP Architecture Diagram" width="480" />
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>AWS architecture diagram</strong><br />
      <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Generate a AWS architecture diagram with **AWS icons**. In this diagram, users connect to a frontend hosted on an instance.</p>
      <img src="./public/aws_demo.svg" alt="AWS Architecture Diagram" width="480" />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>Azure architecture diagram</strong><br />
      <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Generate a Azure architecture diagram with **Azure icons**. In this diagram, users connect to a frontend hosted on an instance.</p>
      <img src="./public/azure_demo.svg" alt="Azure Architecture Diagram" width="480" />
    </td>
    <td width="50%" valign="top">
      <strong>Cat sketch prompt</strong><br />
      <p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Draw a cute cat for me.</p>
      <img src="./public/cat_demo.svg" alt="Cat Drawing" width="240" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
</div>

## How It Works

The application uses the following technologies:

-   **Next.js**: For the frontend framework and routing
-   **Vercel AI SDK** (`ai` + `@ai-sdk/*`): For streaming AI responses and multi-provider support
-   **react-drawio**: For diagram representation and manipulation

Diagrams are represented as XML that can be rendered in draw.io. The AI processes your commands and generates or modifies this XML accordingly.

## Multi-Provider Support

-   AWS Bedrock (default)
-   OpenAI
-   Anthropic
-   Google AI
-   Azure OpenAI
-   Ollama
-   OpenRouter
-   DeepSeek

All providers except AWS Bedrock and OpenRouter support custom endpoints.

📖 **[Detailed Provider Configuration Guide](./docs/ai-providers.md)** - See setup instructions for each provider.

**Model Requirements**: This task requires strong model capabilities for generating long-form text with strict formatting constraints (draw.io XML). Recommended models include Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0, and DeepSeek V3/R1.

Note that `claude-sonnet-4-5` has trained on draw.io diagrams with AWS logos, so if you want to create AWS architecture diagrams, this is the best choice.

## Getting Started

### Run with Docker (Recommended)

If you just want to run it locally, the best way is to use Docker.

First, install Docker if you haven't already: [Get Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

Then run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -e AI_PROVIDER=openai \
  -e AI_MODEL=gpt-4o \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key \
  ghcr.io/dayuanjiang/next-ai-draw-io:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Replace the environment variables with your preferred AI provider configuration. See [Multi-Provider Support](#multi-provider-support) for available options.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DayuanJiang/next-ai-draw-io
cd next-ai-draw-io
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Configure your AI provider:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
cp env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and configure your chosen provider:

-   Set `AI_PROVIDER` to your chosen provider (bedrock, openai, anthropic, google, azure, ollama, openrouter, deepseek)
-   Set `AI_MODEL` to the specific model you want to use
-   Add the required API keys for your provider
-   `ACCESS_CODE_LIST`: Optional access password(s), can be comma-separated for multiple passwords.

> Warning: If you do not set `ACCESS_CODE_LIST`, anyone can access your deployed site directly, which may lead to rapid depletion of your token. It is recommended to set this option.

See the [Provider Configuration Guide](./docs/ai-providers.md) for detailed setup instructions for each provider.

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

Or you can deploy by this button.
[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FDayuanJiang%2Fnext-ai-draw-io)

Be sure to **set the environment variables** in the Vercel dashboard as you did in your local `.env.local` file.

## TODOs

-   [x] Allow the LLM to modify the XML instead of generating it from scratch everytime.
-   [x] Improve the smoothness of shape streaming updates.
-   [x] Add multiple AI provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure, Ollama)
-   [x] Solve the bug that generation will fail for session that longer than 60s.
-   [ ] Add API config on the UI.
